iIf you want to submit a POST request

    You have to set the “request header” section of the Firefox plugin to have a “name” = “Content-Type” and “value” = “application/x-www-form-urlencoded”
    Now, you are able to submit parameter like “name=mynamehere&title=TA” in the “request body” text area field

Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
